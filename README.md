Implementation of neural network quine (https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05859).
The original paper didn't publish code, so this is my attempt to reproduce their work.

## Vanilla Quine
The first achievement of this paper was making a neural network quine that just reproduces its own weights.
This is replicated in the file `mains/vanilla_quine.py`.
